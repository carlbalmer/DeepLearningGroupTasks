I have a fuzzy idea but i don't know the general structure of the project so.
In NN and CNN, there is this problem of optimizer and convergence, with recent proposals ententions of SGD. Can we propose also a variant.
Recent proposals kind look into fussing already exciting concepts in the loss space in relation physics- (OTI)

I think it would be interesting to do a non-ComputerVision project. Maybe something related to reinforcement learning, GANs or NLP.
Some ideas:
-Text Generation (eg. "Generating Click-bait headlines")
-Game Playing (learning to play a [video] game)
-Generating Music (eg. generating "fake" Mozart symphonies)

I already mentioned it, but it might be a stupid idea: Create handwritten text out of two (or more) handwritings. (Andrea)
