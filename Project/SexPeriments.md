Small Network 1 Pooling Layer

Plots:

-Loss/ACC over Epoch SExpLog vs MaxPool

--Different LR, optimizer (SGD, Adam)

-gradient of SExpLog over epoch (showing convergence)

Larger Network, multiple Pooling Layers

-vizualize the three layers (do they learn to be different)

Maybe

-check if the rest of the network learns different filters because of the SExpLog layer

-check if the A-SExpLog learns different things for different datasets
