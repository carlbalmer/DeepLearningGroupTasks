\section{Exercise 1}
\subsection{Cross Entropy}
H(y,g)= -(0*log(0.25)+1*log(0.6)+0*log(0.15))=0.222
\subsection{Mean Squared Error Loss}
MSE(y,g)= $\frac{1}{3}(0.25^2+(-0.4)^2+0.15^2)$=0.0817
\subsection{Hinge Loss}
SVM(y,j)=max(0,1.25)+max(0,0.4)max(0,1.15)=2.8

\section{Evaluation metrics}
\subsection{Accuracy}
$$ACC = \frac{TP+TN}{P+N}$$, high accuracy of predicting predominant class is easily achieved and misleading.
If we have highly unbalanced data the problem of accuracy as a metric is quite apparent:
Let's consider an example with medical data: normally only a few patients have a certain disease.
If our dataset consists of 200 patients, of which only 8 have cancer, than a classifier which predicts
that no patient has cancer would yield 96 percent accuracy;
this prediction however would be deadly for the patients.
If we also consider false negatives, than we see that in every case of a cancer patient,
the classifier predicted no cancer and thus false negatives are 100 percent.The ability to  capture misclassifications in a satisfying way is what is lacking in the accuracy metric.
\paragraph{}
In a muti-class setting, exact matching does not distinguish between partially correct and completely incorrect labeling.
The denominator, \textbf{P+N} which is equivalent to number of samples(N) is constant. It is thus sensitive to only how many labels correctly identified with respect to \textit{N}
\paragraph{}
 $$F1 =\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{2|{T_i}\cap{P_i}|}{|P_i|+|T_i|}$$
 The hamonic mean of precision $F1 =\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{|{T_i}\cap{P_i}|}{|T_i|}$ and recall$Recall =\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{|{T_i}\cap{P_i}|}{|P_i|}$
 $$J_{acc} =\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{|{T_i}\cap{P_i}|}{|{T_i}\cup{P_i}|}$$
 which can e rewritten as
 $$J_{acc} =\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{|{T_i}\cap{P_i}|}{|P_i|+|T_i|-|{T_i}\cap{P_i}|}$$
 $$J_{acc}\leq{F1}$$
